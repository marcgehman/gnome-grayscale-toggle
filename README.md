# Grayscale Toggle for GNOME Shell

Allows you to make individual windows grayscale, or, if you prefer, the entire workspace.

- `Super-G`: Toggle grayscale for the currently active window.
- `Super-Shift-G`: Toggle global grayscale, while also allowing you to still toggle individual windows. Affects all windows and the GNOME UI.
